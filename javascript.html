What can you do about an overproduction of mucus in your throat?
If the overproduction of mucus becomes a regular and uncomfortable occurrence, consider consulting with your healthcare provider for a full diagnosis and a treatment plan.
<br>
Over-the-counter and prescription medications
Your doctor may recommend medication such as:
<br>
Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Expectorants, such as guaifenesin (Mucinex, Robitussin) can thin and loosen mucus so it will clear out of your throat and chest.
Prescription medications. Mucolytics, such as hypertonic saline (Nebusal) and dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) are mucus thinners that you inhale through a nebulizer. If your excess mucus is triggered by a bacterial infection, your doctor will most likely prescribe antibiotics.
Self-care steps
Your doctor may also suggest some self-care steps you can take to help reduce mucus, such as:
<br>
Gargle with warm salt water. This home remedy can help clear mucus from the back of your throat and may help kill germs.
Humidify the air. Moisture in the air can help keep your mucus thin.
Stay hydrated. Drinking enough liquids, especially water, can help loosen congestion and help your mucus flow. Warm liquids can be effective but avoid caffeinated beverages.
Elevate your head. Lying flat can make it feel like the mucus is collecting in the back of your throat.
Avoid decongestants. Although decongestants dry secretions, they may make it more difficult to reduce mucus.
Avoid irritants, fragrances, chemicals, and pollution. These can irritate mucous membranes, signaling the body to produce more mucus.
If you smoke, try to stop. Quitting smoking is helpful, especially with chronic lung disease such as asthma or COPD.
